## Project Title
CivicGreen – Gamified Municipal Sustainability Dashboard

## Problem Statement Addressed
"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"

## Project Overview
CivicGreen is a gamified municipal dashboard that promotes eco-awareness and sustainable community actions.

- Municipalities **earn points** for completing eco-friendly activities such as waste collection, recycling drives, and maintaining public cleanliness.
- **Negligent municipalities are flagged** with **blinking alerts and mock social media posts**, ensuring public accountability.
- Municipalities can **redeem earned points** for community benefits such as streetlights, recycling bins, and community food drives.
- The system **motivates competition and engagement** through a **tiered leaderboard (1–5)** and a **fully animated interactive UI**.

**Who Benefits?**  
- Municipalities gain structured feedback and rewards for sustainability.  
- Citizens benefit from cleaner neighborhoods and improved community facilities.
